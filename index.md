## Trends in prices for apartment rents in Germany

This project is to show trends in rent prices in apartments through Germany. <br>
The idea was to help investors and public to be aware of rent changes in the apartment, no matter their location. The main question is why some apartments are more expensive, despite they have the same size and are located in the same city.

[Supermarket Marketing Analysis](https://github.com/Keglev/Instacart_project/)
<br>
<br>
This project is to show the consumer behavior in a well-known online supermarket store, named Instacart. This project is made in python, and shows how a large dataset can be analyzed and get insights from consumer behavior on it. Some of the proposed business questions were:
<br>
- To find out the heavy user profile - if they are single, married or have kids
- the most departments visited by the customers
- if there were differences in expenditure between different regions
- what was the most busy time of the day for customers, and which day of the week most consumers used the store.

### SQL Project in Postgres and Tableau
<br>
The objective of this project is to answer top common business cases to stack holders:

- What are the 5 top countries with the top users?
- What is the average revenue from gender and which movies are the most rented?
<br><br>
To answer these questions, I used SQL to filter data from a larger dataset and data stored in a Postgres server. This shows the relevancy of SQL for filtering data for business purposes and analyzing the results in Tableau.<br>
Since there are a clear deadline to answer these questions, I faced many issues regarding the fact that some of the questions can be challenged to answer, for example, the top user maybe not come from the top countries with the most revenue. So I need to filter with different queries to get the results.
