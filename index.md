### Data Visualization with Tableau and Python 
This project is to show trends in rent prices in apartments through Germany. <br>
The idea was to help investors and general public to be aware of rent changes in the apartment, no matter their location. The main question is why some apartments are more expensive, despite the have the same size and are located in the same city.

### SQL Project in Postgres and Tableau
<br>
The objective of this project is to answer top commom business cases to stackholders:
- What are the 5 top countries with the top users?
- What is the average revenue from gender and which movies is the most rented?
To answer these questions, I used SQL to filter data from a larger dataset and data Stored in a Postgres server. This shows the relevancy of SQL for filtering data for business purposes and analysing the results in Tableau.
Since there are a clear deadline to answer these questions, I faced many issues regarding the fact that some of the questions can be challenged to answer, for example, the top user maybe not come from the top countries witht he most revenue. So I need to filter with different queries to get the results.
