## Rent prices in Germany - How expensive to rent an apartment can be?

**Project description:** The project is an analysis of the apartments value rent in diferent states in Germany. Some big main cities are included. 
The data was collected in 2019 through API Scrapping techniques from Immowelt website and was stored in Kaggle website.
Despite the fact this data was old, (it was before the pandemic of 2020-2021) it is still relevant today, since the trends did not change after the end of the pandemic.
This project is to answer important business questions, and despite the values are outdated, are still relevant today. The complexity of the dataset and also the size of it make the dataset relevant for a good Data analysis project.
The Data passed through the following techniques:
 - Accessment the Data
 - Cleaning the missing and irrelevant values
 - wrangling data
 - analysis using the Python libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn
 - drawing conclusions and making a Tableau presentation

## Business questions

- The size of the apartment impacts the value?
- The numnber of rooms can impact a rent value?
- new constructions can be higher in value for the same apartment type or not?
- the heat type can have a impact in rent?
